1.Fully to  understand the Four different stateSpace: 
    SE(3) A state in SE(3): position = (x, y, z), quaternion = (x, y, z, w) 
    SE(2) A state in SE(2): (x, y, yaw) 
    SO(3) A State space sampler for SO(3), using quaternion representation  
    SO(2) A state space,a rotation yaw to repsent.
 When it  comes to the real robot motion palnning,  i no longer can say that for a complete planing, there  no longer is not a problem
 of planning two points in euclidean space , but a actual SE(3) state0(moving start SE(3) state ) to SE(3)(goal state) state1. It has been
 more complete from the perspective of math and the realistic problem.
